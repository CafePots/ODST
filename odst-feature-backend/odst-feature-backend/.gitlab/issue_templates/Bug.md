---additional information about bugs you may find valuable---

**Bugs:** A bug is a defect in a feature that has already been accepted. You should not use bugs to detail new features and functionality (e.g., “Price should be non-negative” or “Login button doesn’t work”). Bugs are directly related to features that have already been delivered and provide no new user value, which is why they do not have points. The other reason they do not have points is that bugs can be impossible to estimate and could take 30 seconds or 30 days to resolve.

Bugs should include the following information:

- **Title:** This should be short and descriptive.
- **Description:** What is currently happening? What should be happening?
- **Instructions:** Outline the steps to reproduce it.
- **Resources:** Include screenshots and other assets to help explain/show the bug.
