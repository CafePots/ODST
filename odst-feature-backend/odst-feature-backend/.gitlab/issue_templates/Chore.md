**Description:**
[Why is it needed? Does this help the team go faster? Describe with a number. Is it a dependency that will lead to problems in the codebase if it is not done?]

**Resources:**
[Instructions, additional context, or other assets that help execute the chore]

---additional information about chores you may find valuable---

**Chores:** A chore is a story that is necessary but provides no direct, obvious value to the user (e.g., “Setup new domain and wildcard SSL certificate to create test environments” or “Evaluate tools for system troubleshooting”). Chores can represent technical debt and/or points of dependency on other teams. Chores are not estimated (i.e., pointed), as they do not contribute user value directly. This means that if a chore feels like it provides user value then it should be incorporated into a feature story. For example, if you are using an analytics service, the additional complexity of the service setup should be taken into account in the first analytics feature story, rather than separated out as a chore.

Chores should include this information:
-  **Title:** This should be short and descriptive.
- **Description:** Why is it needed? Does it help the team go faster or is it a dependency that could cause problems in the codebase if it’s not done?
- **Resources:** Including instructions, additional context, or other assets that help execute the chore.
